                The internet had first come about when two individuals, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, decided to work on the
                design of the internet. Our internet that we know and love today was the result of another experiment,
                ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency NETwork) and was started from an experimental packet wide
                network. The Internet is made up of independently operated networks which is fully distributed. It is
                “a tangible physical system made to move information”.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:verdana,serif">
                Information is vastly available on the internet and is broken down into small individual pieces known as
                packets. Each packet has a destination in mind while being routed through different paths depending on
                which route is optimal and has less traffic. The packets reach their destination once they have found
                the IP Address of the destination. Using the IP Address, a host computer can send messages over easily to
                another because of each IP Address being unique. The DNS is also used to associate an IP Address with a
                domain name to help with lookups and connecting to the internet faster which was ultimately found by ICANN.
                This communication process, however would not be possible if HTTP protocols were not established. These
                protocols define the rules and conventions for communicating with another network and provides users with
                high performance and reliability. To make sure information being sent back and forth is secure, HTTPS
                was established.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:verdana,serif">
                Finally, looking at the display of a web page, HTML and CSS are one of the design languages that give a
                website its overall look and feel. W3C helps with defining the web standards for these design languages
                to make information easily available for anyone.
