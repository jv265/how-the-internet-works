            <h3>Definitions</h3>
            <p style="font-family:verdana,serif; text-align: left">
                <b>IP Address: </b><br>
                An IP Address is basically a series of numbers that's unique to each computer on the network. Its similar
                to a mailing address where each of the numbers in the address are represented in bits that are 32 bits
                long.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:verdana,serif; text-align: left">
                <b>Packets: </b><br>
                A packet is essentially small segment of a larger message that is made up of binary sequences of 1's and
                0's. Each packet can be combined to form the whole message which is achieved when all packages reach its
                intended destination. They are sent physically through means of either electric wires, fiber optic cables
                or wireless networks.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:verdana,serif; text-align: left">
                <b>Routing: </b><br>
                Allows for the transportation of data with an internet protocol address which are eventually sent to the
                destination. It helps to manage traffic between networks and its also smart enough to guide packets through
                different paths based on load and the best available path.
            </p>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p style="font-family:verdana,serif; text-align: left">
                Based on the above image, the whole transportation process between packets and routing through IP Addresses
                can be thought of as a package delivery system. Whenever item(s) are shipped through Amazon, the packages
                can take multiple different routes to get to the house to deliver through when broken down. The house can
                be considered the IP address here and the packages being broken down to make the delivery process smoother
                the packets and finally the routing as the best paths to take to reach the address. Multiple different
                issues can arise such as unintended traffic etc. Therefore, careful routing is very important in making sure
                that all packages (packets) arrive as fast as possible.

            <h3>Why are these useful?</h3>
            <p style="font-family:verdana,serif; text-align: left">
                The breakdown of a message into packets so that a message arrives quicker. Without an IP Address, we
                wouldn't be able to access a specific internet resource. The same can be said for packets and routing,
                where if routing was never established, we'd never be able to send messages to another receiver nor be
                able to ensure its delivered quickly.
